Techniques such as polynomial feature generation, interaction features, and logarithmic transformations are implemented. These efforts aim to uncover latent relationships and enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns within the data.

## Model Training and Evaluation
One of the key sections in the notebook is devoted to training and evaluating machine learning models. Multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression, are employed. Each model is meticulously trained using the preprocessed dataset, and appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques are utilized to assess their performance. The notebook provides a comprehensive evaluation of each model, allowing readers to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## Model Comparison and Selection
In order to identify the most accurate and reliable model for predicting house prices, a comparison is conducted among the trained models. Evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared value, are utilized to gauge the models' performance. This comparison serves as a crucial step in selecting the optimal model that can provide accurate predictions on unseen data.

## Model Deployment
The notebook concludes by discussing the potential deployment of the trained model for predicting house prices. It explores the avenues for utilizing the model in real-world scenarios, highlighting its practical applications and benefits. By the end of the notebook, readers are equipped with a comprehensive understanding of the entire machine learning pipeline, from data exploration to model deployment.
